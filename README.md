# Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website repository! Visit [www.luckyrz.com](https://www.luckyrz.com) to see it live.

## Overview

This is my personal portfolio website built with Next.js, showcasing my work and experience. The website consists of three main sections:

- **Home**: Landing page with introduction and highlights
- **About**: Detailed information about my background and skills
- **Works**: Showcase of my projects and portfolio

## Technology

This website is built with:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework for production
- Custom Google Font using [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization)
- Modern web development practices and optimizations

## Development

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Structure

You can start editing the pages by modifying files in the `app` directory:
- `app/page.tsx` - Home page
- `app/about/page.tsx` - About page
- `app/works/page.tsx` - Works page

The site will auto-update as you edit the files.
